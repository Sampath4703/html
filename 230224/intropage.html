<p>SV Restaurant SINCE 1990

    Why It's Effective
    
    Rather than calling itself a “Andhra Spices” or using the word "SVs uses its headline to make a specific claim — ”SV Restaurant since 1990” — that demonstrates those ideas. This captures more attention and paints a richer, more vivid picture of its history and role in the community. The rest of the description supports this by adding details to the story of its founding and explaining that even three decades later, its scratch approach to cooking remains the same.</p>
